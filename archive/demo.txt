Renata Avila is no stranger to protests. An international lawyer and digital 
rights advocate from Guatemala, she has represented indigenous victims of genocide 
and other human rights abuses. Seven years ago, she stood outside the London Stock 
Exchange, waving placards for social justice, a fair financial system and 
accountability for those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. Today, she’s 
sipping coffee at one of the places against which she would have been rioting just 
a decade ago – the World Economic Forum (WEF).
